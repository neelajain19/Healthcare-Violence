			<span class="name"><b>W</b></span>orkplace violence may be responsible for the leading number of workers’ compensation claims filed by employees in the healthcare and social assistance industry in New York City according to experts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Analysis of New York State Workers’ Compensation Board claims data dating back to 2022 found that over the past three years the healthcare and social assistance industry in New York City accounted for the highest total number of claims filed per year as compared to other industries. Healthcare and social assistance claim volume was at least 50% greater each year than claim volume for transportation and warehousing, the second highest ranked industry by claim total. Injuries caused by a fellow worker, patient or other individual accounted for 22% of healthcare and social assistance industry claims, greater than the sum of the next three highest causes of claim injury.

			This trend in workers’ compensation claims aligns with increasing levels of reported workplace-related violence in the healthcare industry across the United States says Dr. Gordon Gillespie, Ph.D., a research expert on workplace violence against healthcare workers at the University of Cincinnati College of Nursing. “Nearly all the workplace violence that goes on in healthcare is unreported and a lot of it is verbal abuse and it happens so frequently that people dismiss it and go about their day.  But the verbal abuse and the assaults have gone up over the last ten years,” he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			The rate of injuries from violent attacks against healthcare professionals increased by 63% between 2011 and 2018 according to the most recent data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9206999/#:~:text=Workplace%20violence%20is%20constantly%20on,and%20economic%20restraints%20%5B5%5D." target="_blank"> Factors contributing to workplace violence in healthcare settings</a> include attitudes and expectations of patients and family members during intense emotional situations, healthcare staffing issues and a lack of training  as well as healthcare system or environmental factors such as long waiting hours and differences in language and culture.     
		</p>

		<p>
			Gillespie, a former emergency department nurse, said that while the <a href="https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/sites/default/files/nnu/documents/0224_Workplace_Violence_Report.pdf" target="_blank">COVID-19 pandemic certainly exacerbated the issue</a>, it is difficult to identify with certainty the cause of the increased levels of violence reporting. “The hard part is how much is whether healthcare workers are less tolerant because it used to be a part of the job.  When I started my clinical practice nearly 30 years ago, I was assaulted over 100 times in my first few years of practice, but that’s just kind of normal,” he said. “The younger generation coming in doesn’t accept it as part of the job, and therefore are more likely to report. So there’s a lot we don’t know for sure – if  it’s truly that people are more violent or people are less tolerant for supporting higher rates," he noted.

			Taryn Amberson, a registered nurse and Ph.D. candidate in occupational health services research at the University of Washington who co-authored a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376998339_Overview_of_Occupational_Injuries_Among_Registered_Nurses_in_Washington_State_2007_to_2019" target="_blank"> study examining occupational injuries among registered nurses in Washington state</a>, cited the need for more robust legislation protecting healthcare workers from workplace violence. "The needle has been moving way too slow," she said. "I think it's hard to understand the culture of healthcare unless you've been in it and experienced violence or an assult. So I think healthcare workers telling their stories, personalizing the problem to legislators would help move the needle a lot," she explained.

			The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced in September that it plans to release the <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202404&RIN=1218-AD08" target="_blank">Prevention of Workplace Violence in Health Care and Social Assistance</a> proposed rule by December in anticipation of implementation in 2025. The rule would require healthcare employers to implement workplace violence prevention programs and other measures to protect employees.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is currently no federal statute in place to place to protect workers from workplace violence according to OSHA. When referencing protection measures for workplace violence, it cites the <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/oshact/section5-duties" target="_blank">General Duty Clause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970</a> which requires employers to provide their employees with a place of employment that is ‘free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm’.
